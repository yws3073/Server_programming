How to compile a new static lib (pthreadVC2.lib) in VC6 from cmd.exe command line:

  VCVARS32.BAT
  nmake clean VC-static

Should work just the same for VC7.1 and VC 2005 (Express) etc.

NOTE: VCVARS32.BAT is part of Visual Studio. For VC6 it 
is usually found in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\
